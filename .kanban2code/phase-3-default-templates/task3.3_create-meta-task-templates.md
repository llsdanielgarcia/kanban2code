# Task 3.3: Create Meta-Task Templates

## Goal

Create templates for tasks that generate other tasks, enabling efficient project planning and management.

## Background

Meta-tasks are special tasks that help create and manage other tasks. They provide structured ways to break down work and audit progress.

## Scope

Create 3 meta-task templates:
1. `create-roadmap.md` - Generate project roadmap (with pre-questions)
2. `split-phase.md` - Split phase into tasks with tests
3. `audit-phase.md` - Audit phase and update audit file

## Files to Create

- `_templates/tasks/create-roadmap.md`
- `_templates/tasks/split-phase.md`
- `_templates/tasks/audit-phase.md`

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All 3 meta-task templates are created
- [ ] Clear instructions for AI on output format
- [ ] Reference to AI guide for task creation
- [ ] Evaluation criteria included where applicable
- [ ] Templates follow consistent structure
- [ ] Pre-questions guide proper input

## Testing Requirements

Verify each meta-task template produces valid output when used.

## Notes

Meta-tasks should include specific instructions for AI agents on how to structure their output to ensure consistency.
