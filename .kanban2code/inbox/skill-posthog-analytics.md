# Create Skill Guide: PostHog Analytics

## Goal
Document PostHog integration patterns to ensure clear separation between client and server tracking.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Document client-side provider initialization.
- [ ] Detail server-side tracking setup using `posthog-node`.
- [ ] Provide patterns for page view auto-tracking.
- [ ] Define standard custom event structures for core workflows.

## Notes
The guide must emphasize the separation of environments to avoid runtime errors.
