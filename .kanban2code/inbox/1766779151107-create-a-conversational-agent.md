# Create a conversational agent

I want to have an agent that I can use to talk to about my ideas, an agent that asks me clarifying questions and refine the prompt once I have had a back and forth, I want an agent who is friendly and ask 1 or max 2 questions, repeat back, a "like talking to a human agent" so i can get ideas and prompts and a big level, this agent doesn't go into specific it's more a high level conversastion.
