# End-to-End Workflow Validation

## Goal
Manually test the complete agent-driven workflow to ensure it works end-to-end.

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Manual test: Create task without template, agent generates content
- [ ] Manual test: Full orchestration pipeline (roadmap → tasks)
- [ ] Manual test: Execution pipeline (plan → code → audit → complete)

## Context
This task validates the new agent-driven workflow through manual testing. We need to ensure all parts of the pipeline work correctly together from initial task creation through to completion.
