# How Kanban2Code Works

Welcome to your new Kanban board!

## Folder Structure
- **inbox/**: New tasks start here.
- **projects/**: Organize tasks by project.
- **_archive/**: Completed tasks go here.

## Workflow
1. Create a task in the sidebar.
2. Drag it to 'Plan' or 'Code' on the board.
3. Mark it as 'Completed' to archive it.
