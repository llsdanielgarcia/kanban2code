## Background

AIs need clear guidance on when to update which context files to maintain project continuity and accurate tracking.

## Scope

- When to update phase-context.md
- When to create/update audit-phase#.md
- Format for updates
- Examples of good updates

## Files to Modify

- `.kanban2code/_context/ai-guide.md` - Add context update workflow section

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Architecture.md update triggers are documented
- [ ] Phase-context.md update triggers are defined
- [ ] Audit-phase#.md creation/update rules are clear
- [ ] Update format is specified
- [ ] Good update examples are provided
- [ ] Workflow is easy to follow

## Testing Requirements

Verify the workflow documentation is clear and actionable for AI agents.

## Notes

Context updates should be minimal but sufficient to maintain project continuity.
