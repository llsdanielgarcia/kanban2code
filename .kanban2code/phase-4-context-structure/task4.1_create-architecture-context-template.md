# Task 4.1: Create Architecture Context Template

## Goal

Create a template for project-level architecture context that provides high-level project information.

## Background

Projects need a central place to document architecture decisions, technology stack, and key patterns that inform task creation and implementation.

## Scope

- Project overview section
- Technology stack documentation
- File structure explanation
- Key patterns and conventions
- Integration points
- Placeholder sections with guidance

## Files to Create

- `_templates/context/architecture.md` - Architecture context template

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Template includes project overview section
- [ ] Technology stack section is included
- [ ] File structure explanation is provided
- [ ] Key patterns and conventions are documented
- [ ] Integration points are defined
- [ ] Placeholder sections include clear guidance
- [ ] Template is minimal yet comprehensive

## Testing Requirements

Verify the template can be used to create a valid architecture.md file.

## Notes

This template should be lightweight and focused on providing essential context for task creation without excessive documentation.
