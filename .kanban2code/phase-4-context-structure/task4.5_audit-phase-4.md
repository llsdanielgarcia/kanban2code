# Task 4.5: Audit Phase 4

## Goal

Review context structure and templates to ensure they are minimal, complete, and functional.

## Background

After creating all context templates and workflows, we need to audit them to ensure they provide necessary context without excessive documentation.

## Scope

- Check workflow documentation is clear
- Validate file naming conventions
- Test context loading in extension
- Review update instructions

## Files to Modify/Create

- `.kanban2code/_context/audit-phase4.md` - Audit documentation

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Templates are minimal yet complete
- [ ] Workflow documentation is clear
- [ ] File naming conventions are consistent
- [ ] Context files load correctly in extension
- [ ] Update instructions are actionable
- [ ] Audit document is created with findings

## Testing Requirements

- Test each template in the extension
- Verify context loading works
- Check file naming consistency
- Validate update workflows

## Notes

The audit should focus on ensuring the context system provides value without creating unnecessary overhead.
